With over 15 years of experience in the Hi-Tech industry and more than 7 years in trading, I have served as a Solution Architect, Head of the Data Department at a top Asian digital bank, and founder of various tech projects. My experience spans collaborations with major companies such as eBay, Art.com, Kohls, HomeDepot, as well as innovative FinTech startups. Outside of the professional realm, I am an avid fan of cross-country marathons, yoga, paddling, and winter swimming.

With 9+ years of marketing experience in Hi-Tech, Blockchain, Edtech, E-commerce and FinTech projects, and over 7 years in cryptocurrency trading, I am a strong believer in the transformative power of Blockchain technology. It is rapidly and irreversibly changing our world by massively embedding itself into our daily lives. Beyond my professional expertise, I am a passionate practitioner and advocate of Yoga, Breathing Techniques, and Ice Baths.
